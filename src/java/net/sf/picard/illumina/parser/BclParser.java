    /**
     * EAMSS is an Illumina Developed Algorithm for detecting reads whose quality has deteriorated towards
     * their end and revising the quality to the masking quality (2) if this is the case.  This algorithm
     * works as follows (with one exception):
     *
     * Start at the end (high indices, at the right below) of the read and calculate an EAMSS tally at each
     * location as follow:
     * if(quality[i] < 15) tally += 1
     * if(quality[i] >= 15 and < 30) tally = tally
     * if(quality[i] >= 30) tally -= 2
     *
     *
     * For each location, keep track of this tally (e.g.)
     * Read Starts at <- this end
     * Cycle:       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
     * Bases:       A  C  T  G  G  G  T  C  A
     * Qualities:   32 32 16 15 8  10 32 2  2
     * Cycle Score: -2 -2 0  0  1  1  -2 1  1           //The EAMSS Score determined for this cycle alone
     * EAMSS TALLY: 0  0  2  2  2  1  0  2  1
     *                    X - Earliest instance of Max-Score
     *
     * You must keep track of the maximum EAMSS tally (in this case 2) and the earliest(lowest) cycle at which
     * it occurs.  If and only if, the max EAMSS tally >= 1 then from there until the end(highest cycle) of the
     * read reassign these qualities as 2 (the masking quality).  The output qualities would therefore be
     * transformed from:
     *
     * Original Qualities: 32 32 16 15 8  10 32 2  2    to
     * Final    Qualities: 32 32 2  2  2  2  2  2  2
     *                           X - Earliest instance of max-tally/end of masking
     *
     * IMPORTANT:
     * The one exception is: If the max EAMSS Tally is preceded by a long string of G basecalls (10 or more, with a single basecall exception per10 bases)
     * then the masking continues to the beginning of that string of G's. E.g.:
     *
     * Cycle:       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
     * Bases:       C  T  A  C  A  G  A  G   G  G  G  G  G  G  G  C  A  T
     * Qualities:   30 22 26 27 28 30 7  34  20 19 38 15 32 32 10 4  2  5
     * Cycle Score: -2  0  0  0  0 -2 1  -2  0  0  -2 0  -2 -2  1 1  1  1
     * EAMSS TALLY: -2 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -3 -4 -2 -2  -2 0   0  2  4 3  2  1
     *                                                          X- Earliest instance of Max-Tally
     *
     * Resulting Transformation:
     * Bases:                C  T  A  C  A  G  A   G   G  G  G  G  G  G  G  C  A  T
     * Original Qualities:   30 22 26 27 28 30 7  34  20 19 38 15 32 32 10  4  2  5
     * Final    Qualities:   30 22 26 27 28  2 2   2   2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2
     *                                                          X- Earliest instance of Max-Tally
     *                                       X - Start of EAMSS masking due to G-Run
     *
     * To further clarify the exception rule here are a few examples:
     * A C G A C G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G A C T
     *                                                 X - Earliest instance of Max-Tally
     *     X - Start of EAMSS masking (with a two base call jump because we have 20 bases in the run already)
     *
     * T T G G A G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G A G A C T
     *                                                 X - Earliest instance of Max-Tally
     *         X - We can skip this A as well as the earlier A because we have 20 or more bases in the run already
     *     X - Start of EAMSS masking (with a two base call jump because we have 20 bases in the run)
     *
     * T T G G G A A G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G T T A T
     *                                                 X - Earliest instance of Max-Tally
     *           X X - WE can skip these bases because the first A counts as the first skip and as far as the length of the string of G's is
     *                 concerned, these are both counted like G's
     *           X - This A is the 20th base in the string of G's and therefore can be skipped
     *         X - Note that the A's previous to the G's are only included because there are G's further on that are within the number
     *             of allowable exceptions away (i.e. 2 in this instance), if there were NO G's after the A's you CANNOT count the A's
     *             as part of the G strings (even if no exceptions have previously occured) In other words, the end of the string of G's
     *             MUST end in a G not an "exception"
     *
     * However, if the max-tally occurs to the right of the run of Gs then this is still part of the string of G's but does count towards
     * the number of exceptions allowable
     * (e.g.)
     * T T G G G G G G G G G G A C G
     *                         X - Earliest instance of Max-tally
     *  The first index CAN be considered as an exception, the above would be masked to
     *  the following point:
     *  T T G G G G G G G G G G A C G
     *      X - End of EAMSS masking due to G-Run
     *
     * To sum up the final points, a string of G's CAN START with an exception but CANNOT END in an exception.
     *
