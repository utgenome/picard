/**
 * Holds a single chain from a UCSC chain file.  Chain file format is described here: http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html
 *
 * In a chain file, a chain consists of a header line followed by alignment data lines.  Chain class embodies the header
 * line, and the list of ContinuousBlocks embodies the alignment data lines.
 *
 * A continuous block represents a continuous range of the "from" genome that maps to a continuous range of the "to"
 * genome of the same length.  A chain is an ordered list of continuous blocks, with gaps between the continuous blocks.
 * All the continuous blocks in a chain must map from a single "from" sequence to a single "to" sequence.  All the
 * continuous blocks in a chain map from the positive strand in the "from" genome build to the same strand in the
 * "to" genome build.  The gaps in between the continuous blocks in a chain represent un-lift-overable regions.
 * A gap in a chain must not be found in another chain.  If so, the chain containing the gap should be split into
 * two chains.
 *
 * In UCSC liftOver terminology, the "target" is the "from" genome build, and the "query" is the "to" genome build.
 * E.g. when mapping from HG18 to HG19, the HG18 coordinates are "target" and HG19 is "query."  The USCS terminology
 * is not used here because it confuses me.
 *
 * Chain coordinates are zero-based, half open.  However, there is also an Interval attribute of Chain that is in
 * standard Picard coordinates, i.e. one-based inclusive.
